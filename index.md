## Tutorial Lab Sessions: Generating Music with Deep Learning

Please bring your laptop and suitable headphones/earphones.
The practical exercises are run from within a web browser using
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). To launch
the notebook click the corresponding "Open in Colab" link.

(TODO: remove temp links to dev notebooks once material is settled)

* **Lab 1: Data** (2 Feb 2023)
    * In this lab we build a text-encoded dataset of classical piano music.

* **Lab 2: Learning** (23 Feb 2023)
    * In this lab we use the compiled dataset from Lab 1 to train a small GPT-style model
      to generate music in a similar style.

* **Lab 3: Synthesis & Effects** (2 Mar 2023)
    * In this final session we tweak the instrument sound and apply
      a variety of audio effects to the music generated in Lab 2.
